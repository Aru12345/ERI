          Earth Rights Institute (ERI) takes an innovative approach to combine
          education, advocacy, and research in building ecologically,
          economically, and culturally sustainable communities in some of the
          world's poorest regions. ERI advocates for a development model that
          re-localizes expertise. We believe empowering communities to direct
          their own development starts with locally conceived strategies and
          knowledge.
